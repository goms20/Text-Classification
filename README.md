# Text-Classification

**Natural Language Processing for Text Classification with NLTK and Scikit-learn**

The dataset used here was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

By using NLP, text classification can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of predefined tags or categories based on its context. NLP is used for sentiment analysis, topic detection, and language detection. There is mainly three text classification approach:
1.Rule-based System
2.Machine System
3.Hybrid System

In the **rule-based approach**, texts are separated into an organized group using a set of handicraft linguistic rules. Those handicraft linguistic rules contain users to define a list of words that are characterized by groups.
**Machine-based classifier** learns to make a classification based on past observation from the data sets. User data is prelabeled as tarin and test data. It collects the classification strategy from the previous inputs and learns continuously. Machine-based classifier usage a bag of a word for feature extension.
**Hybrid approach** usage combines a rule-based and machine Based approach. Hybrid based approach usage of the rule-based system to create a tag and use machine learning to train the system and create a rule. Then the machine-based rule list is compared with the rule-based rule list. If something does not match on the tags, humans improve the list manually. It is the best method to implement text classification.
